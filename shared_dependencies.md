Shared Dependencies:

### Exported Variables:
- `theme` (for toggling between dark and light mode)
- `companyProfile`, `plantProfile`, `assetProfile`, `sensorProfile` (for the respective forms and data models)
- `temperatureData` (for storing and displaying temperature data from sensors)
- `alarmStatus` (for displaying the current alarm status)
- `sensorSettings` (for DAQ configuration settings)

### Data Schemas:
- `Company` (Company Name, Address, city, state/province, country, zip code/postal code, phone number, email)
- `Plant` (Plant name, Address, city, state/province, country, zip code/postal code, phone number, email)
- `Asset` (Asset Name, Plant ID, capacity, rating, Temperature threshold)
- `Sensor` (Sensor name, Sensor family, Sensor type, Sensor variant, Asset ID, position)

### ID Names of DOM Elements:
- `temperature-chart` (for the real-time temperature chart)
- `polar-trend-plot` (for the polar trend plot)

### Function Names:
- `initializeDatabase` (for the script that initializes the database)
- `saveDatabaseState` (for the function that saves the current state of the database)
- `openDatabase` (for the function that opens a database from the user's machine)
- `toggleTheme` (for the function that toggles between dark and light mode)
- `calculateDailyTemperatures` (for the function that calculates daily max, min, and average temperatures)
- `generateMockData` (for the function that generates mock data for demo mode)

- `configureDAQ` (for the function that configures the DAQ system)
- `sendNotification` (for the function that sends system notifications)
- `sendEmailAlert` (for the function that sends email alerts)

These shared dependencies would need to be consistently named and used across the various components and utilities to ensure that the application functions correctly and that the code is maintainable.
